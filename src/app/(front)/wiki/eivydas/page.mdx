# Biography

We don't know much about Eivydas **Biography**, but what we know that he is from some region near **Kėdainiai**, lives in some farm that we're not sure what he does there, but it must be potentially farming of some sort.

# Skills

From my experiance Eivydas is not that good at programming he just knows basic about **Html, CSS, Javascript**. He relies on [Chatgpt](https://chatgpt.com/)
To many times, and when he uses Chatgpt he doesn't learn from it or make Chatgpt question complex things that he personally doesn't know
to learn it from.

Also Compared to me (_Armandas_), Eivydas is not good at programming.
But I think he has potential to be great programmer if he really wishes to

In summary he has potential to be great programmer, and other than that thats all we know
