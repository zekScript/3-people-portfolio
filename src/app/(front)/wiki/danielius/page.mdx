# Danielius

**Danielius**, (_liet. Danielius Laurinaviƒçius_), came to [KITM](https://kitm.lt/) same time as me (_Armandas_).
Danielius does not have many friends but he's best friend is [Vakaris]("/wiki/vakaris").

In classes, he has his phone out as always, and there will be patterns to other classmates

I would think that Danielius got suggested by some friend from Kaunas or [Vakaris]("/wiki/vakaris") told him to go to KITM
he picked Javascript programming course and to this day he's still learning Javascript programming

# Biography

Redacted

# Skills

Danielius is pretty decent at programming at some occasions, what i've seen before learning Javascript, he is pretty good at [Python](https://www.python.org/).

Danielius has potential at programming maybe he'll be able to to work as a programmer but to be honest I doubt it

# Notes

So in summary Danielius is pretty decent at programming at some point also he's best friend is [Vakaris](/wiki/vakaris)

other than that I don't know much personally about him
